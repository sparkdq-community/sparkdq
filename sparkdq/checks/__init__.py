"""
This module serves as the dynamic entry point for the sparkdq.checks subpackage.

It recursively traverses all submodules within the sparkdq.checks package to identify and register
all classes that inherit from either `BaseRowCheckConfig` or `BaseAggregateCheckConfig`.

Each valid check configuration class is added to the moduleâ€™s global namespace and included in
`__all__`, ensuring it becomes part of the public API.

This approach eliminates the need for manual imports and `__all__` maintenance, making the system
easy to extend as new check classes are added. It also allows developers and users to import any
check configuration directly from the top-level `sparkdq` namespace.

This mechanism incurs a small runtime overhead during the initial import of `sparkdq.checks`,
but improves maintainability and scalability significantly in large modular frameworks.
