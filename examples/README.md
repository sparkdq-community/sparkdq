# Examples

This directory contains practical examples that demonstrate how to use the SparkDQ framework in real-world scenarios.   Each example is self-contained and focuses on a specific use case, such as:

- Validating completeness of key columns
- Quarantining invalid records during ingestion
- Applying fail-fast logic for critical schema checks
- Combining validation strategies dynamically

These examples are designed to help you quickly understand how to apply the core features of SparkDQ in your own pipelines.
