# SparkDQ ‚Äî Data Quality Validation for Apache Spark

Most data quality frameworks weren‚Äôt designed with PySpark in mind. They aren‚Äôt Spark-native and often lack proper support for declarative pipelines. Instead of integrating seamlessly, they require you to build custom wrappers around them just to fit into production workflows. This adds complexity and makes your pipelines harder to maintain. On top of that, many frameworks only validate data after processing ‚Äî so you can‚Äôt react dynamically or fail early when data issues occur.

**SparkDQ** takes a different approach. It‚Äôs built specifically for PySpark ‚Äî so you can define and run data quality checks directly inside your Spark pipelines, using Python. Whether you're validating incoming data, verifying outputs before persistence, or enforcing assumptions in your dataflow: SparkDQ helps you catch issues early, without adding complexity.

## Quickstart Examples

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

from sparkdq.engine import BatchDQEngine
from sparkdq.management import CheckSet

spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

df = spark.createDataFrame(
    [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"},
        {"id": 2, "name": None},
        {"id": 3, "name": "Bob"},
    ]
)

# Declarative configuration via dictionary
# Could be loaded from YAML, JSON, or any external system
check_definitions = [
    {"check-id": "my-null-check", "check": "null-check", "columns": ["name"]},
]
check_set = CheckSet()
check_set.add_checks_from_dicts(check_definitions)

result = BatchDQEngine(check_set).run_batch(df)
print(result.summary())
```

### Why declarative?
Define checks as dictionaries that can be loaded from YAML/JSON files, stored in databases, or generated by APIs ‚Äî perfect for CI/CD pipelines and data contracts.

### Prefer Python-native development?
Alternatively, you can define checks using Python classes for full type safety, IDE autocompletion, and compile-time validation. [See docs](https://sparkdq-community.github.io/sparkdq/) for examples of both approaches.

## Installation

### For Local Development / Standalone Clusters

Install with PySpark included:

```bash
pip install sparkdq[spark]
```

### For Databricks / Managed Platforms

Install without PySpark (runtime provided by platform):

```bash
pip install sparkdq
```

The framework supports Python 3.10+ and is fully tested with PySpark 3.5.x. SparkDQ will automatically check for PySpark availability on import and provide clear error messages if PySpark is missing in your environment.

## Why SparkDQ?

* ‚úÖ **Robust Validation Layer**: Clean separation of check definition, execution, and reporting

* ‚úÖ **Declarative or Programmatic**: Define checks via config files or directly in Python

* ‚úÖ **Severity-Aware**: Built-in distinction between warning and critical violations

* ‚úÖ **Row & Aggregate Logic**: Supports both record-level and dataset-wide constraints

* ‚úÖ **Typed & Tested**: Built with type safety, testability, and extensibility in mind

* ‚úÖ **Zero Overhead**: Pure PySpark, no heavy dependencies

## Typical Use Cases

SparkDQ is built for modern data platforms that demand trust, transparency, and resilience.
It helps teams enforce quality standards early and consistently ‚Äî across ingestion, transformation, and delivery layers.

Whether you're building a real-time ingestion pipeline or curating a data product for thousands of downstream users,
SparkDQ lets you define and execute checks that are precise, scalable, and easy to maintain.

**Common Scenarios**:

* ‚úÖ Validating raw ingestion data

* ‚úÖ Enforcing schema and content rules before persisting to a lakehouse (Delta, Iceberg, Hudi)

* ‚úÖ Asserting quality conditions before analytics or ML training jobs

* ‚úÖ Flagging critical violations in batch pipelines via structured summaries and alerts

* ‚úÖ Driving Data Contracts: Use declarative checks in CI pipelines to catch issues before deployment
